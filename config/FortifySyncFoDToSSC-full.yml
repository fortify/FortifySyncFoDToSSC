# This sample configuration file lists all available configuration settings.

# All configuration settings support the use of property references denoted by 
# ${propertyName}. At runtime, these property references will be replaced with 
# the value of the corresponding Java system property or system environment
# variable. For example, a property reference like ${FOD_URL} below would be
# replaced with either the value of the FOD_URL environment variable, or the
# value for this property can be specified through the -DFOD_URL=... option
# on the Java command line.
#
# The following property references are automatically defined, but can be 
# overridden on the Java command line:
# - ${fortify.home}
#   Default value: FORTIFY_HOME environment variable if defined,
#                  ~/.fortify otherwise
# - ${sync.home}
#   Default value: ${fortify.home}/FortifySyncFoDToSSC


# Configure log levels for both utility and 3rd-party packages
# Valid log levels: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, OFF
logging.level:
  # Set the log level for standard utility logging output.
  # Default value: INFO
  com.fortify.sync.fod_ssc: DEBUG 

  # Log level for other packages can be adjusted in a similar way. As an example, 
  # setting the following log levels to TRACE would log all request and response 
  # data. Note that this can reveal sensitive data like FoD and SSC credentials and 
  # tokens, and may severely affect performance.
  # Default values: INFO
  org.apache.http: INFO 
  org.glassfish.jersey: INFO

# Uncomment the following line to also log to a file.
# ${sync.home} corresponds to ${fortify.home}/FortifySyncFoDToSSC
# Default value: not configured
logging.file: ${sync.home}/logs/FortifySyncFoDToSSC.log


# Configure the connection to FoD
sync.connections.fod:
  # Configure FoD connection details and credentials from required environment variables
  # Default values: not configured
  baseUrl: ${FOD_URL} # https://{region}.fortify.com
  tenant: ${FOD_TENANT}
  userName: ${FOD_USER} # Either dedicated user, or increase rateLimitMaxRetries below
  password: ${FOD_PWD}  # May use PAT that has view-apps and view-issues scopes
  
  # To use client credentials, comment out tenant/userName/password fields and uncomment 
  # the following to configure client id and secret from required environment variables
  # Default values: not configured
  #clientId: ${FOD_CLIENT_ID} 
  #clientSecret: ${FOD_CLIENT_SECRET}
  
  # Configure the number of retries if FoD rate limit is exceeded
  # If userName configured above is only used for this integration,
  # this can be left at the default (1). If userName is also used
  # by other integrations, you may want to increase this to retry
  # multiple times in case the other integration is assigned a free 
  # rate limit slot.
  # Default value: 1
  rateLimitMaxRetries: 1
  
  # Configure the proxy used to access FoD from optional environment variables
  # Default values: not configured

  # Default values: not configured
  baseUrl: ${SSC_URL}
  userName: ${SSC_USER}
  password: ${SSC_PWD}
  
  # To use an SSC authentication token, comment out userName/password fields
  # and uncomment the following to configure authentication token from required
  # environment variable. 
  # Default values: not configured
  #authToken: ${SSC_AUTH_TOKEN} 
      
  # Configure the proxy used to access SSC from optional environment variables
  # Default values: not configured

# Configure the SyncScans task
sync.tasks.syncScans:
  # Sync scans every minute at the 0-second mark

  scansTempDir: /tmp/scans

  # By default, scans downloaded from FoD will be deleted immediately after they
  # have been uploaded to SSC. Setting this property to a non-zero value will 
  # persist downloaded scans for the configured number of minutes, which can be
  # useful for debugging purposes. Any scans for which the configured number of 
  # minutes has passed will be deleted whenever the syncScans task runs again.
  # Default value: 0
  deleteScansOlderThanMinutes: 5
      
  # Ignore any scans on FoD if they are older than this number of days.
  # FoD has a retention policy of 2 years, after which scans are no longer
  # downloadable. As such, the default value for this property is 730 days. 
  # Setting this property to more than 730 days may cause errors when 
  # trying to download older scans. Optionally, this property can be set
  # to a smaller number of days, like 365 or 30, if you want to ignore
  # older scans.
  # Default value: 730
  ignoreScansOlderThanDays: 30


# Configure the LinkReleases task
